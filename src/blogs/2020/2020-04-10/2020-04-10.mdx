A delay time calculator is essential tool when adding effects to your sound. We know that adding effects is a way to enhance a sound using tools like the volume fader, panning, delay, and reverb.

A Delay time calculator is useful when you want to add effects to your sound. Effects are ways to enhance our sound so it sounds bigger, wider, or deeper. One main reason for a delay calculator is to time your delays with the tempo of your track, doing this will add depth without being noticeable other wise it stick out.

I usually have to look at a delay chart to see what the delay time would be at a specific tempo. Instead I want to create my own calculator to find the delay times for each note length.
