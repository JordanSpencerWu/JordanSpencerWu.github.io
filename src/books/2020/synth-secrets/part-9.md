Voltage Controlled Amplifier, or 'VCA'

Digitally Controlled Amplifier, or 'DCA'

Time-variant Amplifiers, or 'TVA'

> Whenever you have more than one amplifier and/or attenuator in series, you can calculate the Gain of the whole system simply by multiplying the individual Gains together.

> One of the most common uses for VCAs is to modify the actions of CVs using other CVs;

> We should not differentiate between amplifiers in the audio signal chain and those used to modify control voltages.

> Whenever you have more than one amplifier and/or attenuator in series, you can at any moment calculate the Gain of the whole system simply by multiplying the individual Gains — at each instant — together.
