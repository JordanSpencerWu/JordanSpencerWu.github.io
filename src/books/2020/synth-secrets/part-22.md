when you place an echo unit at the end of a signal chain: you play a note and, after the original, you hear a number of repetitions, usually dying away over the course of a few seconds.

if you place a reverberator at the end of the chain, your note is extended, with added 'ambience' â€” the perception that the note is produced in a room or hall of some sort.

Delays occur when sound reflects off solid objects.

#### Three distinct temporal parts of reverberation:

1. the original click
2. 'early reflections'
3. the 'reverb' portion of the reverbed click

the human brain is not usually capable of perceiving echoes separated by less than 30 milliseconds as distinct sounds

natural reverberation dies away to silence, and we use a measure called the 'Reverberation Time' to quantify the rate at which it does so.
