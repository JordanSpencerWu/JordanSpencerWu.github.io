you could represent any waveform as a set of sine waves. This method of generating a complex sound is often called Fourier synthesis.

Fourier analysis — the mathematical method used to break sounds down into sine waves — and Fourier synthesis — building them back up again.

because, at any given moment, you can describe any waveform in terms of the frequencies and amplitudes of its components, you can take the appropriate number of sine waves and mix them together at the appropriate frequencies and in the appropriate quantities to regenerate the waveform.

> No matter how clever the method of synthesis, and no matter how complex an initial waveform may be, any timbre will sound static and 'organ-like' if it does not change in time.

we know that the sound becomes duller as time passes, so the higher-frequency harmonics must decay more rapidly than the lower ones.

we must determine how the overall brightness and loudness of the sound changes as the note progresses, and create filter and amplifier profiles that emulate this.

a true additive synthesizer will allow you to manipulate individually the amplitudes of 32, 64, 128, or even 256 harmonics, and that's something that no pre-patched analogue synthesizer can do.

many of your synthesized sounds will remain unconvincing if they lack a little noise within them.
