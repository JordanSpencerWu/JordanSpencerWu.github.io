there are many, many sounds that you can't imitate using ADSR 4-stage envelopes.

#### ADSR Limitations:

- the voltage at the start of the contour has to be zero
- the Attack phase of the contour always moves in a positive direction
- the ADSR always reaches its maximum level at the end of the Attack
- the Decay is always negative with respect to the Attack
- the Sustain Level always begins at the level reached at the end of the Decay
- the Sustain is a constant voltage
- the Release starts at the Sustain Level
- the Release always moves in a negative direction
- the Release always ends up back at zero

Digital Envelope Generators, or DEGs

many stages the contour generators on your synth have, you can usually recreate the contours of a envelope generator with fewer stages.

> Increasing the complexity of the contour generators adds many possibilities for more detailed sound creation, without precluding the creation of simpler sounds.

> Don't become carried away by the current craze for vintage synths or their DSP-generated descendants. Think about the type of sounds you want to generate, and choose your instrument carefully so that you can produce them.
