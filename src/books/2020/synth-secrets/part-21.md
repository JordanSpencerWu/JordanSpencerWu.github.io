title: From Polyphony To Digital Synths
---

If a polyphonic synth allocates a limited number of voices to the notes as you play, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Likewise, if a polyphonic synth has switches that select between preset patches, it contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Similarly, if a polyphonic synth has user-programmable memories, it too contains a significant amount of digital circuitry. Therefore, a totally analogue polysynth can only be one that offers total polyphony provided by independent articulators for each note, and which has no presets and no memories.

> In mainstream synthesis, there have only ever been two totally analogue polysynths: the Korg PS3100 and PS3300.
