Chowning found that when the frequency of the modulating signal increased beyond a certain point, the vibrato effect disappeared from the modulated tone, and a complex new tone replaced the original.

John Chowning discovered that FM, like AM, generates side bands — additional components, not necessarily harmonically related to the frequency of the Carrier or Modulator — in the frequency spectrum of the output signal.

the sound we hear is not only determined by the frequency of the Modulator, but also by its gain or maximum amplitude.

natural sounds, where increased loudness almost always goes hand-in-hand with increased brightness.

M, we can say the following two things about the relationship between the Modulator and the output signal:

1. The number of significant spectral components and their amplitudes are determined by the Modulation Index, which is proportional to the Modulator's amplitude; but inversely proportional to the Modulator's frequency...

2. For any given Carrier frequency, the position of the spectral components is determined by the Modulator's frequency alone.

> Frequency Modulation is a powerful method of synthesis that is as relevant to analogue synthesizers as it is to digital ones, and which is capable of generating sounds unobtainable by any other method.
