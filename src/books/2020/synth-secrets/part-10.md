modulation, the trick that makes sounds live and breathe in an organic sort of way.

whereas vibrato is a periodic change in the pitch of a sound, tremolo is a periodic change in the loudness of the sound.

You will sometimes see references to duty cycles greater than 50 percent. In essence, for any number X lying between zero and 50, a duty cycle of (50+X) percent is identical to that of (50-X) percent, but the phase is inverted.

> A pulse wave has the same harmonic distribution as a sawtooth wave except that, for a duty cycle of 1:n where n is an integer every nth harmonic is missing from the spectrum.

It's common to use low-frequency oscillators as the source of the modulating control voltages.
