> If we're going to get the best from our synthesizers, we need to understand how their sounds react when played â€” whatever means we use to play them.

#### Types of priority

- lowest-note priority
- highest-note priority
- last-note priority
- first-note priority

> Hang on to a lower note for too long on a lowest-note-priority monosynth, and the following higher note will speak too late, making your playing sound uneven and off the beat. The same is true if you hang on to a higher note too long on a highest-note-priority monosynth, and then follow it with a lower note.

> Hang on to a lower note too long on a highest-note-priority monosynth, and the following higher note will still speak on time, so you'll get away with your bad technique. The same is true if you hang on to a higher note too long on a lowest-note-priority monosynth, and follow it with a lower note.
