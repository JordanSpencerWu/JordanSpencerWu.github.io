When the modulation source is an audio-frequency oscillator and the destination is the Gain of a VCA in the audio signal path, we call the result Amplitude Modulation, or AM for short.

two cases of Amplitude Modulation: one where the Modulator lies at a fixed frequency, and another where the Modulator as well as the Carrier tracks the keyboard, or any other controlling voltage.

fixed-Modulator AM is most useful for creating aggressive and conventionally 'unmusical' sounds that change dramatically as you play up and down the keyboard.

Amplitude Modulation tracking the keyboard, offers a way to create complex non-harmonic timbres that change pitch normally as you play up and down the keyboard.

> Amplitude Modulation is a powerful tool that allows you to create and play new sounds that you cannot obtain using conventional oscillators alone.

Amplitude Modulation which is tremolo at audio frequencies and Filter Modulation which is growl at audio frequencies.
