a Clock Generator provides an evenly spaced stream of 'ticks' in the form of short pulses.

The first involves directing the S&H output to an oscillator's CV input so that it makes the pitch vary randomly. Far less obvious and therefore more interesting than cyclic LFO modulation, it's the key to humanising many digital sounds, and it's absolutely vital to any impersonations of real instruments that waver slightly as the note plays.

The second example requires you to direct the S&H output to the CV input of a low-pass filter. This affects the high-frequency content of the sound and, therefore, each clock pulse changes the timbre of the audio passing through the filter.

analogue sequencer allows you to decide the value of its output CV at every clock step.

Voltage Quantiser, or simply a 'quantiser' â€” a device that rounds every voltage passing through it up or down to that which produces an exact semitone.

'Scale Generator' or Scale Quantiser, a module that quantises the voltage in such a way that the output conforms to a predetermined musical scale.
