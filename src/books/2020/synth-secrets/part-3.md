most natural sounds have complex harmonic structures, and that these derive from the nature of the object making the sound.

unvarying tones are called static or stationary sounds, and they are almost always musically uninteresting.

Control Voltage, or CV

Voltage Controlled Amplifier, or VCA

imagine using the knob to apply varying voltages to create a loudness 'contour' for our sound.

the contour of the CV is identical to the loudness contour. In other words, you have defined the loudness of the sound at any given time using the CV.

Envelope Generator, or EG

most common envelope generators, are called ADSRs. The acronym stands for Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release.

Three of them — Attack, Decay, and Release — are measures of time, while the fourth — the Sustain — is a voltage level.

If this fundamental frequency lies in the range of approximately 20Hz to 20kHz you should hear the sound as an audible tone.

Low Frequency Oscillator, or LFO

The Tone Generator is a Signal Generator — it produces the basic audio tone

The Voltage Controlled Amplifier is an example of a Modifier — it changes the audio signal in some way

The LFO Sinewave generator is acting as a Controller — it is directing the signal-modifying action of the Modifier itself.

an analogue synth uses fluctuating voltage to represent audio signals and other fluctuating voltages to shape and control them. But it's not a signal's source that is important, it's the destination that determines whether it is best viewed as an audio signal or a controller.
