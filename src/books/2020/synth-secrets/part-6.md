the cutoff frequency is directly related to the amount of electrical resistance provided by the resistor, and the capacitance of the capacitor.

$$ f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi RC} $$

by adjusting the value of one or more components in a given filter circuit, you can adjust the cutoff frequency.

all physical objects resonate. Or, to put it another way, almost all objects will vibrate naturally at certain frequencies.

ilters are the defining elements in an analogue synthesizer.
