just because an electronic instrument can play many pitches simultaneously, it isn't necessarily truly polyphonic.

#### Attributes for simpler timbres:

- the principal waveform, which provides both the initial tone and the pitch.
- the changes in brightness and loudness as the note progresses.

monophonic synthesizer has an oscillator that creates the basic waveform, a filter that controls the tone, and an amplifier that controls the loudness. A contour generator determines how the filter and amplifier modify the sound as it develops over time, and the modulator adds vibrato, tremolo and/or growl.

To imitate a moderately complex monophonic sound, or even create a new 'electronic' timbre, you need a minimum complement of an oscillator, a filter, an amplifier, a contour generator and a modulator.

> Just like human beings, sounds are born, reach their prime, and die. Furthermore, if you have more than one person in a room, each must be born, reach his/her prime, and die independently of all the others.
