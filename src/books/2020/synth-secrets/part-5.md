Filter has the abilities to remove parts of the audio spectrum and create new tones from old.

for every doubling of the frequency above the cutoff frequency, the gain at the output is halved.

Since each doubling of the frequency is equivalent to moving up an octave, and each successive halving of the gain is known as an attenuation of 6dB, this response is most commonly called a 6dB/octave filter.

> The cutoff frequency of a passive low-pass filter does not define the frequency at which the filter starts to work; it is itself defined as that frequency at which the signal is already attenuated by 3dB. And, since an attenuation of 3dB is easily perceived by the human ear, this means that you are already significantly affecting the signal at the cutoff frequency.

> A 4-pole filter will always tend to a 24dB/octave rolloff at high frequencies, but it will exhibit regions within which the rolloff is 6dB/octave, 12dB/octave, and 18dB/octave.

> Whether the differences are subtle or glaringly obvious, every analogue filter design sounds different from every other.
