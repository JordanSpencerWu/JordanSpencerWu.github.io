title: What's In A Sound?

The name 'subtractive synthesis' is derived from the method itself, wherein you attenuate or remove harmonics from harmonically rich waveforms to create new sounds.

the first harmonic, the fundamental is the pitch that you'll perceive when you listen to the sound.

At any given moment the number of harmonics present determines the waveform of the sound.

harmonics and the waveforms are just two ways of expressing the same thing.

the natures of musical tones are defined by the numbers and amplitudes of the harmonics contained within them, and any given set of harmonics gives us a given waveform.

#### Sawtooth

> Every harmonic is present, and the amplitude of the nth harmonic is 1/n times that of the fundamental.
