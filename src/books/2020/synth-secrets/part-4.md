title: Of Filters & Phase Relationships

when you mix two offset but otherwise identical signals, the phases of the individual frequencies define a filter.

phase changes lead to filtering, can you assume that filtering leads to phase changes

> Filters not only change a waveform by attenuation, but distort it by individually phase-shifting the harmonics within it.
