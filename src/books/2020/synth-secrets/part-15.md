all synthesizers shared one trait: the initial sound has been generated within the synthesizer.

whatever the nature of the external signal, you can use the Minimoog's filter to create new timbres.

pitch-to-voltage converter, or pitch/CV converter

Slew Generator, they slow down transitions from one voltage to another, thus 'slewing' any abrupt changes over a period.

You will most commonly encounter a slew generator in its role as a 'portamento' circuit, smoothing the transition from one keyboard-generated pitch CV to another.

Envelope Follower strictly speaking, a 'peak amplitude follower' â€” a circuit that measures the amplitude of the positive peaks of the waveform.

the external signal has a very limited ability to modify the timbre of the output.

> If your synthesizer has an external signal input plus an envelope follower and a pitch/CV converter, it is a much more powerful and flexible instrument than it would otherwise be. You should experiment with them!
