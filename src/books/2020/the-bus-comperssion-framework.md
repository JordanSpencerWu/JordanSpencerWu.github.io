title: THE BUS COMPRESSION FRAMEWORK
---

Bus compression does two things:

1. Glue instruments together
2. Allow us to manipulate the overall transient and volume characteristics of entire groups.

Bus compression or pocket compression is a group of instruments that are all being affected by the same compressor.

"Mixing in the pocket" is the ability to create zones, or distinct spaces in your mix.

1. Frequency Pocket = EQing
2. Compression Pocket = Bus Compression

Front = Contrast

Back = Blend

Front Pocket = Slower Attack and Faster Release

Back Pocket = Faster Attack and Slower Release

#### 5 types of buses/groups

1. Leads/Vox - Front Pocket (Glue + Depth)
2. Pads/Keys - Back Pocket (Glue + Depth)
3. Drum Bas - Drum Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)
4. Bass Bus - Bass Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)
5. Aux Bus - Auxiliary Pocket (Glue + Relative Positioning)

#### Back Pocket

1. Send all the instruments you want positioned in the Back Space of your mix to this bus/group.
2. Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).
3. Set Attack .1 - 3ms.
4. Set Release .3 - .6sec.
5. Set Ratio: 2:1
6. Bring the Threshold down until you have 1 - 2db of gain reduction.
7. Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it's necessary to restore any lost volume.

#### Front Pocket

1. Send all the instruments you want positioned in the Front Space of your mix to this bus/group.
2. Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).
3. Set Attack 10 - 30ms.
4. Set Release .1 - .3sec.
5. Set Ratio: 2:1
6. Bring the Threshold down until you have .5 - 1db of gain reduction.
7. Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it's necessary to restore any lost volume.

#### Drum Pocket

1. Send all your drums to the drum bus/group.
2. Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).
3. Set Attack 10 - 30ms.
4. Set Release .1 - .3sec.
5. Set Ratio: 2:1
6. Set your Threshold until you have .5 - 3db of gain reduction.
7. Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it's necessary to restore any lost volume.

#### Bass Pocket

1. Send all your basses to this bass bus/group.
2. Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).
3. Set Attack 10ms.
4. Set Release .1 - .3sec.
5. Set Ratio: 2:1
6. Set upir Threshold down until you have .5 - 1db of gain reduction.
7. Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it's necessary to restore any lost volume.

#### Aux Pocket

1. Send all Auxiliary sounds; FX to this bus/group.
2. Put your desired compressor on the group (SSL Compressor).
3. Set Attack 1 - 3ms.
4. Set Release .3 - .6sec.
5. Set Ratio: 2:1
6. Bring the Threshold down until you have 1 - 2db of gain reduction.
7. Adjust the makeup gain if you feel it's necessary to restore any lost volume.
