title: Radical Candor
---

at the very heart of being a good boss - is a good relationship.

your key responsibility as a boss: to guide your team to achieve results.

Bosses guide a team to achieve results.

three areas of responsibility that managers do have: guidance, team-building, and results.

"Radical Candor" is what happens when you put "Care Personally" and "Challenge Directly" together.

"Bring your whole self to work."

There are two dimensions to good guidance: care personally and challenge directly.

your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from their work.
