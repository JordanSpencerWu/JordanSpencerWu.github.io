title: THE 3-SPACE REVERB FRAMEWORK

#### 3 reverb types

1. Short-decay reverb
2. Medium-decay reverb
3. Long-decay reverb

The longer the decay the more space it takes up.

#### 3-Space Mix Theory

1. Front space
2. Middle space
3. Back space

#### Blend/Contrast Theory and Reverb

1. Reverbs by default will blend together
2. To create more contrast with reverbs we use numerically different settings between each reverb

The most important parameters in any reverb are __pre-delay__, __decay__, and __hi-cut__.

Front Space Categories: Drums, Small Rooms, Studios, Chambers

Middle Space Categories: Chambers, Halls, Medium Rooms, Studios

Back Space Categories: Chambers, Halls, Cathedrals

Mod Depth is the depth of pitch modulation happening within your reverb.

Mod Rate is how fast the pitch modulation move up and down.

1. The higher the mod rate, the less mod depth you can have for the reverb to sound natural.
2. The lower the mod rate, the more mod depth you can have for the reverb to sound natural.

1. A darker reverb will have bass frequencies that last longer relative to the high frequencies.
2. A brighter reverb will have bass frequencies which decay faster relative to high frequencies.

If you want a darker room then make sure the high frequency content decays faster than your bass frequency content.

If you want a brighter room then make sure the low frequency content decays faster than your high frequency content.

The front space is created by using short-decay reverbs.

The middle space is created by using medium-decay reverbs.

The back space is created by using long-decay reverbs.

#### The Front Space Reverb

Predelay: 1 - 10ms
Decay: .2 - 1sec
Hicut: 10k - 20k
Diffusion: To taste. Low diffusion create a more lively, and echoey drum room. High diffusion creates a smoother drum room.
Mod Rate/Depth: Mod depth is somewhere between 5 - 20%
EQ: A drum room's low frequencies should disappear before its high frequencies

#### The Middle Space Reverb

Predelay: 10 - 20ms
Decay: 1 - 2sec
Hicut: 8k - 15k
Diffusion: Set to taste
Mod Rate/Depth: Between 5 - 30%
EQ: Should complement your long-decay reverb's EQ in such a way that they give each other space.

#### The Back Space Reverb

Predelay: 1 - 15ms
Decay: 2 - 8sec
Hicut: 5k - 12k
Diffusion: Usually always at max
Mod Rate/Depth: Between 15 - 50%
EQ: Has the most natural bass decay
