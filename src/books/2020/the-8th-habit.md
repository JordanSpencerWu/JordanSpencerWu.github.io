8th Habit is to Find Your Voice and Inspire Others to Find Theirs.

Voice is unique personal significance that lies at the nexus of talent, passion, need, and conscience.

Whole-Person Paradigm - human beings has four-dimensional body, mind, heart, and spirit.

Four needs of people: to learn, to live, to love, and to leave a legacy.

Most of the great cultural shifts - ones that have built great organizations that sustain long-term growth, prosperity, and contribution to the world - started with the choice of one person.

They find and use their voice.

Inspire others to find their voice.

We all have the power to decide to live a great life.

Inspire means to breathe life into another.

You learn best when you teach another and that learning is internalized when you live it.

To know and not to do, is really not to know.

It is only in the doing, the applying, that knowledge and understanding are internalized.

#### Birth-gifts

1. Freedom and Power to Choose
2. Principles - universal, timeless, and self-evident
3. The 4 Intelligences / Capacities - mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual

Transition person - one who stops unworthy tendencies from being passed on from prior generations to those that follow your children and grandchildren.

When we change our thinking, we change our lives.

There is a "law of the harvest" that governs human characters, human greatness and all human relationships.

He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress.

We are a product of neither nature nor nurture; we are a product of choice, because there is always a space between stimulus and response.

Leaders arenâ€™t made or born; they are self-made - leadership is a function of choices.

Three leadership attributes: vision, discipline, and passion.

All things are created twice: first, a mental creation; second, a physical creation.

Help others find their own voice.

The key to creating passion in your life is to find your unique talents and your special role and purpose in the world.

"Know yourself, control yourself, give yourself."

The more you use and magnify the gifts or talents you have been given, the more gifts and talents you are given.

Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.

Seeing, doing, and becoming.

An organization is made up of individuals who have a relationship and a shared purpose.

#### Four Primary Management Practices:

1. Strategy - Devise and maintain a clearly stated, focused strategy
2. Execution - Develop and maintain flawless operation execution
3. Culture - Develop and maintain a performance-oriented culture
4. Structure - Build and maintain a fast, flexible, flat organization

Inspiring Others to Find Their Voice involves FOCUS and EXECUTION.

The key to influence is always to first be influenced, that is to first be open and seek understanding.

90 percent of all leadership failures are character failures.

Trust is the fruit of the trustworthiness of both people and organizations.

Who we are is more important than who we appear to be?

Trustworthiness comes from character and competence.

Personal character: integrity, maturity and the Abundance Mentality.

Make and keep promises.

Relationship are maintained and deepened only as you actively nurture and build them with regular acts of kindness, consideration, appreciation and service.

Strong relationships require real effort and sacrifice, they require putting someone else's well-being, growth and happiness before your own.

Moral Authority: The principled exercise of free choice, which almost always involves some form of sacrifice.

A trust deposit must mean something to the other person.

Nothing destroys trust faster than making and breaking a promise and nothing build and strengthens trust more than keeping a promise you make.

"Lying makes a problem part of the future; truth makes a problem part of the past."

Adults are big children.

"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is; treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be."

Trust is not only the fruit of trustworthiness; it is also the root of motivation.

Love as a verb is something you do: the sacrifices you make and the giving of self.

Think Win-Win is the idea or principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit.

Empathic listening is to get deeply into the frame of reference of another person.

We do not see the world as it is; we see the world as we are.

To understand does not mean to agree with.

Influence begins with modeling trustworthiness so that people will have confidence in you.

Three primary roles of a leader - pathfinding, aligning, and empowering.

Always seek the higher Third Alternative.

Pathfinding is the first creation.

Alignment - designing and executing systems and structures that reinforce the core values and highest strategic priorities of the organization.

Alignment is institutionalized trustworthiness - the very principles that people have built into their value system are the basis for designing structures, systems, and processes.

Form follows function. Structure follows purpose. Alignment follows pathfinding.

ask "What do you think?"

Successful organizations are system and culture dependent.

Success lies in the system.

The key to the principle of alignment is to always begin with the results.

MODELING PRINCIPLE-CENTERED trustworthy behavior inspires trust without "talking it." Pathfinding creates order without demanding it. Aligning nourishes both vision and empowerment with proclaiming them.

Empowering enthrones self-control, self-management, and self-organizing.

Our greatest financial investment is the knowledge worker.

Servant leadership is about the trust that is consciously given to another - an act that leads me to feel your belief that I can add value.

Duty, love and meaning are the highest sources of human motivation.
