description: A quick read on how to use EQ and compression and when to use them. It's about mixing your sounds together so they sound good together. It's about adding more space to the mix, to add frequency pockets use a EQ and to add volume pockets use compression.

All the most successful producers and mix engineers improved by referencing their favorite songs and paying close attention so they could eventually replicate that sound in their own music.

A mix can be thought of as having two spaces __Front__ and __Back__.

##### Instruments that are up Front:

1. Have more volume compared to instruments in the back.
2. Have more high frequency content compared to instruments in the back.
3. They tend to have less reverb because things that have lots of reverb get pushed further back than things which don't.

##### Instruments that are up Back:

1. Have less volume compared to instruments up front.
2. Have less high frequency content compared to instruments up front.
3. Tend to have more reverb than the instruments up front.

##### EQ has two primary uses:

1. To sculpt and shape the presentation of your instruments.
2. To control the balance between instruments.

##### Two main approaches to EQ:

1. Cutting EQ
2. Boosting EQ

##### The 4 Zones

* Lows: 0hz - 200hz
* Mids: 200hz - 1khz
* High Mids: 1khz - 7khz
* Highs: 7khz - 20khz

The rule of 300 states that if it isn't bass, kick or snare, then you must high pass those instruments at 300hz or higher.

High Pass Filtering: is used to remove unwanted low frequencies.

Low Pass Filtering: is used to remove unwanted high frequencies.

Cutting/Boosting aka Peak Filtering: is when you take a bell-shaped filter and use it to either subtract or add frequencies to a selected range.

Shelving Filters: make something Brighter/Darker or Thicker/Thinner. Set at 1khz or higher, you can make a sound Brighter or Darker sounding. Set at 1khz or less, you make a sound Thicker or Thinner.

Q: is a way to adjust the sharpness of EQ curve.

##### Slingshotting goal is to aim for openness

1. Decide where to put the instrument in the front or back.
2. Set your desire volume to play in front or back.
3. Set Q slope of 1 and select 4db boost for front or -6db for the back.
4. With everything playing move your cut/boost between each of the 4 frequency zone.
5. Once you find your zone, refine your dB amount.

> The real art of mixing is about the Frequency Real Estate you don't use, not the space you occupy.

Less is more.

If there's too many instruments fighting for dominance in a given frequency range, then when we go to limit our track, we increase the intensity of those clashing frequencies.

##### Frequency Sweeping

Frequency sweeping is more surgical and precise, involves a very narrow Q with around + or - 10db of gain.

##### 4 truths about compression

1. Compression is just an automatic volume fader.
2. Anything a compressor can do; volume automation can do.
3. Compressor are designed to make loud sounds quieter.
4. A compressor is just a glorified volume fader.

##### Fader Triggering, when to move down and how much volume to subtract

1. Threshold
2. Ratio
3. Sidechain

##### Fader Velocity, how fast it should move when volume is louder than your threshold

1. Attack
2. Hold
3. Release

The higher the ratio, the more gain-reduction. The lower the ratio, the less gain-reduction.

A Sidechain's purpose is to allow the compressor to act as if it were behaving in response to an EQ'd version of the sound you're treating.

Gain reduction means reducing the volume of a sound.

Attack is how long it takes our automatic volume fader to move downward when the threshold is exceeded by our incoming signal.

Release is how long it will take our automatic volume fader to return back to its original position of 0 volume reduction.

Hold is a way to delay the release phase of our automatic volume fader.

Makeup Gain allows us to restore our instrument to its original perceived volume level.

You'll learn that you have frequency pockets which are managed by EQ's and you have volume leveled pockets which are managed by compression. Having these distinct pockets in your mix means your mixes will have more depth, and therefore more blend and contrast.
