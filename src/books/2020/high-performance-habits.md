title: HIGH PERFORMANCE HABITS
---

To become a high performer, you must seek clarity, generate energy, raise necessity, increase productivity, develop influence, and demonstrate courage.

High performer - someone who creates ever-increasing levels of both well-being and external success over the long term.

High performance refers to succeeding beyond standard norms, consistently over the long term.

High performance is about forming habits that help you both excel in and enrich the full spectrum of your life.

Success is achieved not by a specific type of person, but rather by people from all walk of life who enact a specific set of practices.

| Personal Habits       | Social Habits              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Seek Clarity          | Increase Productivity      |
| Generate Energy       | Develop Influence         |
| Raise Necessity       | Demonstrate Courage        |

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #1: SEEK CLARITY

It's about how you think about tomorrow and what you do stay connected with what matters today.

The essential habit of seeking clarity help high performers stay engaged, growing, and fulfilled over the long haul.

High performers have more clarity on who they are, what they want, how to get it, and what they find meaningful and fulfilling.

Clarity is the child of careful thought and mindful experimentation.

You have to know who you are, what you value, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and where you want to go.

Clear "stretch" goals energize us and lead to greater enjoyment, productivity, profitability, and satisfaction in our work.

Have a specific plan attached to your goals - knowing when and where you will do something.

Focus on the future

###### PRACTICE ONE - ENVISION THE FUTURE FOUR

1. SELF
    * High performers are more focused on sculpting themselves into stronger and more capable people.
    * They are living into their best self now. Imagine your best future self and start acting like that person today.
2. SOCIAL
    * High performers anticipate positive social interactions and they strive consciously and consistently to create them.
3. SKILLS
    * High performers are very clear about the skills sets they need to develop now to win in the future.
    * High performers are also working on skills that focus in their primary field of interest.
    * No matter your current level of performance, clarifying your primary field of interest and the skills you need to master for your next level of success must be a priority.
4. SERVICE
    * When someone becomes disconnected from the future and their contribution to it, they underperform.
    * High performers give an extraordinary amount of thought to questions of service: how to add value, inspire those around them, and make a difference.

###### PRACTICE TWO - DETERMINE THE FEELING YOU'RE AFTER

"What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this situation, and what is the primary feeling I want to get from this situation?"

Think of an emotion as mostly a reaction, and feeling is an interpretation.

High performers contemplate how they want to feel regardless of what emotions might come up, and they envision how they want to feel leaving the situation regardless of what emotions might come up.

My automatic emotion doesnâ€™t have to be in charge. My feelings are my own.

High performers are generating the feelings they want more often than taking the emotions that land on them.

###### PRACTICE THREE - DEFINE WHAT'S MEANINGFUL

High performers spend more of their time doing things that they find meaningful, and this makes them happy.

Our striving for a meaningful life is one of the main factors associated with psychological well-being.

You need to bring more conscious and consistent thought to what you will find meaningful in life.

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #2: GENERATE ENERGY

High performers have the magical trifecta of capital "E" Energy - that holistic kind that includes positive and enduring mental, physical, and emotional vibrancy.

Energy isn't just physical, it's also mental alertness and positive emotion.

The more energy someone has, the more likely they are to be happy and climb to the top of their primary field of interest.

Stress is the ultimate energy and well-being killer.

You can transform your thoughts into feeling you desire.

This means you don't have to "wait" for joy, motivation, love, excitement, or any other positive emotion in life. You can choose to generate it, on demand, any time you want, through the power of habit.

###### PRACTICE ONE - REALEASE TENSION, SET INTENTION

Master transitions where transitions are going between two activities.

1. REALEASE TENSION
    * you can choose to take a break, meditate, or any other ways to deal with stress before starting the next activity.
2. SET INTENTION
    * think about what you want to feel and achieve in the next activity.

###### PRACTICE TWO - BRING THE JOY

High performers experience these three positive emotions: joy, presence, and mindfulness/flow.

Focus on bring more joy into your daily life.

Positive emotion is one of the greatest predictors of the good life - high energy and high performance.

If you feel joy, your mind, body, and emotional reality all get a lift.

Positive emotion is a prerequisite for high performance.

Only you are in charge of your enduring emotional experience. You're in charge of how you feel.

Consciously direct your thoughts and behaviors to generate positive emotions.

Gratitude is the golden frame through which we see the meaning of life.

###### PRACTICE THREE - OPTIMIZE HEALTH

High performers always improve their energy with physical movements and breathing patterns.

To increase our physical energy:

* Exercise - work out more
* Nutrition - eat healthier food
* Sleep - aim for seven to eight hours

Exercising help release tension and stress.

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #3 - RAISE NECESSITY

"Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason, mastery demands all of a person"

Necessity is the emotional drive that makes great performance a must instead of a preference.

Unlike weaker desires that make you want to do something; necessity demands that you take action.

You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it's absolutely necessary to excel.

Performance necessity is one of the most powerful drivers of human motivation and excellence.

Four Forces of Necessity:

1. Identity - High Personal Standards and Commitment to Excellence
    * High performers hold themselves to a high standard
    * Always self-monitoring and are self-aware.
    * High performers make their dream a necessity.
2. Obsession - Obsession with Understanding and Mastering a Topic
    * High performers are curious for understanding and master their primary field of interest.
    * High performers don't need a reward or prod from others to do something, because they find it inherently rewarding.
3. Duty - Social Duty, Obligation, and Purpose
    * High performers often feel the necessity to perform well out of a sense of duty to someone or something beyond themselves.
4. Urgency - Real Deadlines
    * High performance happens only when there are real deadlines.
    * High performers are more focused on doing what really matters when it matters.

###### PRACTICE ONE - KNOW WHO NEEDS YOUR "A" GAME

Being on your "A" game means that you are giving your best effort with full focus on the singular task at hand.

You'll have to immerse yourself fully in activities that force you to stretch.

If you can stoke the necessity to be your best in order to help others, you'll hit high performance faster and stay there longer.

###### PRACTICE TWO - AFFIRM THE WHY

High performers confidently affirm their goals to themselves and others.

It is saying with confidence that something is true and will happen.

###### PRACTICE THREE - LEVEL UP YOUR SQUAD

If you truly want to increase your performance in any area of your life, get around some new people who expect and value high performance.

It's so important to carefully curate who is in your social circle.

You can improve your life on your own however social support makes personal development and overall life success easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

High performers spend more time with positive people.

They are more strategic and consistent in seeking to work with others at or above their level of competence, experience, or overall success.

Spend more time hanging with your positive and successful peers and building a new positive peer group.

You have to be deliberate about raising your level of necessity.

You are only as strong and extraordinary as you give yourself reason to be.

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #4: INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY

High performers score well on statements such as "I'm good at setting priorities and working on what's important," and "I stay focused and avoid distractions and temptations."

The fundamental of becoming more productive are setting goals and maintaining energy and focus.

When most people feel that they're out of balance, it's because one area of their life become more intense, important, and time-consuming than other areas.

Area of life:

1. Healthy
2. Family
3. Friends
4. Intimate Relationship
5. Mission/Work
6. Finances
7. Adventure
8. Hobby
9. Spirituality
10. Emotion

You'll always feel out of balance if you're doing work that you don't find engaging and meaningful.

Take a brief break away from the desk at least every 45 to 60 minutes to increase satisfaction and performance.

###### PRACTICE ONE - INCREASE THE OUTPUTS THAT MATTER

High performers have mastered the art of prolific quality output.

Real work is producing quality output that matters.

Figuring out what you are supposed to produce, and learning the priorities in the creation, quality, and frequency of that output, is one of the greatest breakthroughs you can have in your career.

###### PRACTICE TWO - CHART YOUR FIVE MOVES

To become a high performer request thinking more before acting.

Think of five projects that move you toward achieving your dream can then be broken down into deliverables, deadlines, and activities.

Know the big five moves that will take you to your goal, break those moves down into tasks and deadlines, then put them in a calendar.

###### PRACTICE THREE - GET INSANELY GOOD AT KEY SKILLS

You have to master the primary skills needed to win in your primary fields of interest.

Everything is trainable

You can get better at practically anything if you keep a growth mindset, focus on your goals with passion, and perseverance, and practice with excellence.

You can ensure that you become world-class in that skill through progressive mastery.

Progression mastery involves getting a coach, challenging yourself beyond your comfort zones, developing mental representations of what success should be, tracking your progress, and fixing your weakness.

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #5: DEVELOP INFLUENCE

What matter is your perception of yourself.

One of the primary skills you must master in life is influence.

Influencers understand the power of repetition, so they try multiple times to get their ideas in front of those they hope to influence.

Don't forget to give, giving to others with no expectation of return increases your overall success.

You can double your ability to influence others by giving before you ask for something.

High performers have a giving mindset.

The Ultimate Influence Model:

1. Teach them how to think about themselves, others, and the world.
2. Challenge them to develop their character, connections, and contributions
3. Role model the values you wish to see them embody.

###### PRACTICE ONE - TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK

There are three things you want your followers thinking about themselves, other people, and the greater world.

###### PRACTICE TWO - CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO GROW

High performers challenge the people around them to rise to higher levels of performance themselves.

If your intentions are clearly to help someone grow and become better, and you speak to them with respect and honor, then your challenges will inspire better action.

Influencers challenge other in three realms: their character, their connections with others, and their contributions.

###### PRACTICE THREE - ROLE MODEL THE WAY

High performers give a lot of time thinking about being a role model.

High performers act in ways that gets someone to improve who they are, or achieve a specific result.

High performers just don't do manipulation.

##### HIGH PERFORMANCE HABIT #6: DEMONSTRATE COURAGE

High performers are courageous people.

High performers report taking action despite fear much more than others do.

Courage is not fearlessness; it is taking action and persisting despite that fear.

The more we do something successfully, the more comfortable we become with it.

The more actions you take facing fear, expressing yourself, and helping others, the easier and less stressful these actions become.

Moral courage is speaking up for others or enduring hardship for what you believe is right, to serve the greater good.

Psychological courage is the act of facing or overcoming your own anxieties, insecurities, and mental fears.

Everyday courage could mean keeping a positive attitude or taking action despite great uncertainty, bad health, or hardship.

The important thing is that you define what being more courageous means to you, and start living that way.

###### PRACTICE ONE - HONOR THE STRUGGLE

We'll have to get better at dealing with life's challenges.

See the struggle as part of our growing character.

High performance requires real intention and the mastering of complex habits.

When we learn to see struggles as a necessary, important, and positive part of our journey, then we can find true peace and personal power.

Struggle must be seen as part of the process and a vitally important part of any worthwhile endeavor.

Embrace the suck. You have to deal with it, face it, and will yourself to persevere and rise. You will make it through.

Remember, you are stronger than you think, and the future hold good things for you.

###### PRACTICE TWO - SHARE YOUR TRUTH AND AMBITIONS

When we live our truth, expressing who we really are, how we really feel, what we really desire and dream of, then we are authentic, we are free.

The only path is to express your own truth and pursue your own dreams.

###### PRACTICE THREE - FIND SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR

It comes from wanting to serve another, to love another, to fight for another.

We will do more for others than for ourselves. And in doing something for others, we find our reason for courage, and our cause for focus and excellence.

##### The 3 C's OF CONFIDENCE

###### PRACTICE ONE - DEVELOP COMPETENCE

High performers are learners, and their belief that they can learn what is necessary to win in the future gives them as much confidence as their current skills sets.

###### PRACTICE TWO - BE CONGRUENT

They shaped their identity by conscious will and have aligned their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to support that identity.

###### PRACTICE THREE - ENJOY CONNECTION

High performers have learned the tremendous value in relating with others.
