description: A very useful handbook for mixing engineers. The most important learning for me is timing the delay time to the tempo of the track. This in my opinion gives the track a groove that sounds good.

### Mixing Approach

1. Determine the Direction of the Song
2. Develop the Groove
3. Find the Most Important Element and Emphasize It.

### Rule For Arrangements

1. Limit the number of elements
2. Everything in its own frequency range.

### Goals of Equalization

1. To make an instrument sound clearer and more defined
2. To make the instrument or mix bigger and larger than life
3. To make all the elements of a mix fit together better by putting each instrument in its own predominate frequency range

tremolo is a cyclic variation in volume

vibrato changes the pitch of the sound.

It's important to time the delay to the track in order for it to pulse with the song.

$1/4\,Note = (60\,Sec\,/\,BPM) * 1000$

$Dotted\,Value = Delay\,Time * 1.5$

$Triplet\,Value = Delay\,Time * (2/3)$
