Software construction is similar to construction of house, school, or a skyscraper. There are many complicated processes like problem definition, requirement development, software architecture, detailed design, coding and debugging, unit testing, etc. Construction refers to the process of building, in this case it's mostly coding and debugging along with other activities.
