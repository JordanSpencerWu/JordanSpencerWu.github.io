title: How Program Size Affects Construction
---

As the number of people on a project increases, the number of communication path increases, it increases multiplicatively, proportionally to the square of number of people. The more communication path you have, the more time you spend communicating and the more opportunities are created for communication mistakes. As project size increases, a larger percentage of errors can usually be attributed to mistakes in requirements and design.

> The product that's twice as large is likely to have more than twice as many errors.

As project size increases, construction becomes a smaller part of the total effort.

Regardless of the size of a project, a few techniques are always valuable: disciplined coding practices, design and code inspections by other developers, good tool support, and use of high-level languages.

A more sophisticated kind of program is a software "product," a program that's intended for use by people other than the original developer.

Another level of sophistication is required to develop a group of programs that work together. Such group is called a software "system".
