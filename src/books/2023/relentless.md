Stop at nothing to get to the end result.

If you want to be unstoppable, you've got to make the commitment.

Tell yourself what to do.

Don't think.

You already know what you have to do, and you know how to do it.

Everything you need to be great is already inside you.

Decide. Commit. Act. Succeed. Repeat.

You become unstoppable - by placing no limits on yourself.

Success isn't the same as talent.

If you're aiming to be the best at what you do, you can't worry about whether your actions will upset other people, or what they'll think of you.

Relentless is about achieving the impossible.

"In order to have what you really want, you must first be who you really are."

take responsibility for everything.

All that matters is the end result.

Listen to your gut.

If you aim at excellence, you have to be willing to sacrifice.

You can't be relentless unless you're willing to take chances.

You have to crave that pressure, embrace it, and never let up.

Nothing is impossible.

Every dream you imagine, everything you see and hear and feel in your sleep, that's not a fantasy, that's your deep instinct telling you it can all be real. Follow those visions and dreams and desires, and believe what you know. Only you can turn those dreams into reality. Never stop until you do.

The greatest battles you will ever fight are with yourself, and you must always be your toughest opponent.

Always demand more of yourself.

Be honest with yourself.

Listen to your instincts.

Everything you want can be yours.

The ability to win is in all of us.

The ability to achieve the end results over and over.
