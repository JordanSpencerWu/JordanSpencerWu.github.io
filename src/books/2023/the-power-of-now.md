"You have it already. You just can't feel it because your mind is making too much noise."

## Chapter One You Are Not Your Mind

become intensely conscious of the present moment.

learn to disidentify from your mind.

Your mind is an instrument, a tool.

You cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.

two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the pain from the past that still lives on in your mind and body.

## Chapter Two The Way Out of Pain

Human pain is self-created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life.

Pain on the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgment.

Pain on the emotional level, it is some form of negativity.

the more you are able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering - and free of the egoic mind.

Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.

Make the Now the primary focus of your life.

Stay present. Stay conscious.

True Power is within

The secret of life is to "die before you die." - and find that there is no death.

## Chapter Three Moving Deeply Into The Now

The mind is a wonderful tool.

End the delusion of time. Time and mind are inseparable. Remove time from the mind and it stops - unless you choose to use it.

To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation.

This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it to be.

The more you are focused on time - past and future - the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.

Life is now.
Nothing ever happened in the past, it happened in the Now.

Nothing ever happened in the future, it will happen in the Now.

Past and future reality is "borrowed" from the Now.

In the Now, in the absence of time, all our problems dissolve.

Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time.

Through self - observation, more presence comes into your life automatically. The moment you realize you are not present, you are present.

Be present as the watcher of your mind.

Don't judge or analyze what you observe.

learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life - but immediately return to present - moment awareness when those practical matters have been dealt with.

The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always the Now, but they are still peripherally aware of time.

The present moment is all you ever have.

The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future - which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now.

The quality of your consciousness is your degree of presence.

The only place where true change can occur and where the past can be dissolved is the Now.

recognize that time is the cause of your suffering or your problems.

Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.

Problems are mind-made and need time to survive.

When your deeper sense of self is derived from Being, when you are free of "becoming" as a psychological need, neither your happiness nor your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is freedom from fear.

## Chapter Four Mind Strategies For Avoiding The Now

when you can feel every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free of time.

Loss of Now is loss of Being

Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your presence.

Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; you don't want the present.

Life is your deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect.

Gratitude for the present moment and the fullness of life now is true prosperity.

Feel the fullness of life now

Only the present can free you of the past.

You find yourself by coming into the present.

## Chapter Five The State of Presence

When you become conscious of Being, what is really happening is that Being becomes conscious of itself. When Being becomes conscious of itself - that's presence.

I am not teaching you. You are conscious, and you are listening to yourself.

## Chapter Six The Inner Body

The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind.

The mind cannot forgive. Only you can.

## Chapter Seven Portals Into The Unmanifested

the inner body is felt without a boundary.

Free from bondage to form and identification with form.

Unmanifested, the invisible Source of all things, the Being within all beings.

A realm of deep stillness and peace, but also of joy and intense aliveness.

Inner body as a portal through which you enter the Unmanifested.

You cannot be in your body without being intensely present in the Now.

Continuous mind activity keeps you imprisoned in the world of form and becomes an opaque screen that prevents you from being conscious of the Unmanifested, conscious of the formless and timeless God - essence in yourself and in all things and all creatures.
"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."

The essence of all things is emptiness.

death is an illusion, just as your identification with form was an illusion. The end of illusion - that's all that death is. It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion.

## Chapter Eight Enlightened Relationship

Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now.

True Salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It is to be who you are, to feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that depends on nothing outside itself.

True salvation is to know yourself as an inseparable part of the timeless and formless One Life from which all that exists derives its being.

True salvation is a state of freedom - from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. It is freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as a psychological need.

True love has no opposite.

Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. They bring out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you.

The power of Now, the power of presence that dissolves that past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illusion.

To know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment.

the moment that judgment stops through acceptance of what is, you are free of the mind.

Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you.

All love is the love of God.

If you accept that the relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy, then the relationship will offer you salvation, and you will be aligning yourself with the higher consciousness that wants to be born into this world.

Consciousness can only come into this world through you.

Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people to be as they are.
woman is naturally closer to Being and potentially closer to enlightenment than a man.

To go beyond the mind and reconnect with the deeper reality of Being, very different qualities are needed: surrender, non-judgement, an openness that allows life to be instead of resisting it, the capacity to hold all things in the loving embrace of your knowing.

As a general rule, the major obstacle for men tends to be the thinking mind, and the major obstacle for women the pain-body.

you are responsible for your inner space now - nobody else is - and that the past cannot prevail against the power of the Now.

Do not use the pain-body to give you an identity. Use it for enlightenment instead. Transmute it into consciousness.

You are one-half of the Whole. This incompleteness is felt as male-female attraction, the pull toward the opposite energy polarity, no matter how conscious you are.

In the state of enlightenment you are yourself. You do not judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are not proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not hate yourself, and so on.

When you are enlightened, there is one relationship that you no longer have: the relationship with yourself.

## Chapter Nine Beyond Happiness and Unhappiness There Is Peace

Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within it. Although you may not see it at the time. Even a brief illness or an accident can show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and what doesn't.

conditions are always positive. There is only a higher good - which includes the "bad".

Forgiveness of the present is even more important than forgiveness of the past. If you forgive every moment - allow it to be as it is - then there will be no accumulation of resentment that needs to be forgiven at some later time.

The awakening of Being - consciousness through what appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering into inner peace.

Whenever you are not honoring the present moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama.

When you are fully conscious, you cease to be in conflict.

On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and destruction, growth and dissolution, of seemingly separate forms.
Failure lies concealed in every success, and success in every failure.

Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you joy.

To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness.

no fear of loss. Life flows with ease.

All inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form or another.

All negativity is resistance.

Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of what is, surrender to the Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it teach you integrity - which means to be one, to be yourself, to be real. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and how not to make living and dying into a problem.

"Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present."

every moment is the best.

At the level of Being. All suffering is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due to identification with form.
Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between yourself and all creatures.

Nothing that was real ever died.

Your primary task is to awaken out of identification with form.

Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.

You teach through being, through demonstrating the peace of God.

True change happens within

"Love you enemies."

"have no enemies."

primary focus, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace your most precious gift to the world.

## Chapter Ten The Meaning Of Surrender

Practice surrender in your everyday life.

The quality of your consciousness at this moment is the main determinant of what kind of future you will experience.
Lean from nature

only through the letting go of resistance, through becoming "vulnerable," can you discover your true and essential, invulnerability.
Surrender is inner acceptance of what is.

your Life, you very Being in the timeless Now.

Surrender transform you

Illness is not the problem. You are the problem - as long as the egoic mind is in control.

Anything "bad" that happens in your life - use it for enlightenment

Do not resist the pain. Allow it to be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it mentally. Embrace it.

By giving full attention is full acceptance, is surrender.

Presence removes time. Without time, no suffering, no negativity, can survive.

When you surrender to what is and become fully present, the past ceases to have any power. You do not need it anymore.

Presence is the key. The Now is the key.
