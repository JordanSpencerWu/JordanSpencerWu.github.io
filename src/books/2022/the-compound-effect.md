title: The Compound Effect - Jumpstart Your Income, Your Life, Your Success
---

You reap what you sow; you can't get out of life what you're not willing to put into it.

When you study and master the science of achievement, you will find the success you desire.

Your own decisions shape your destiny.

Success is simple. Do the right things and keep doing them day in and day out.

You already know what you need to succeed.

You do not need new information. You need a new plan of action.

Slow and steady wins the race.

I'll win because of the positive habits I've developed, along with the consistency I use in applying those habits.

No excuses. If you aren't good at something, work harder, work smarter.

Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE

Profound success was the result of small, smart choices, completed consistently over time.

The reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect.

The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable.

The secret to success is hard work, discipline, and good habits.

People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.

Your only path to success is through a continuum of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and somtimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time.

The life we end up with is simply an accumulation of all the choices we make.

Everything in your life exists because you first made a choice about something.

Choices are at the root of every one of your results.

Each choice starts a behavior that over time becomes a habit.

In essence, you make your choices and then your choices make you.

It's the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your success.

Only when you're willing to take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work will it work.

You alone are responsible for what you do or don't do, or how you respond to what's done to you.

The Complete Formula For Getting Lucky - Preparation + Attitude + Opportunity + Action = Luck

The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.

The first step toward change is awareness.

Track every action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve.

To get results you have to take some action.

All winners are trackers.

Your life is the product of your moment to moment choices.

We are what we repeatedly do.

Habit: An acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.

Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams.

You MUST know your why.

When the reason is big enough, you will be willing to perform almost any how.

Success without fulfillment is failure.

Core values define both who you are and what you stand for.

If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.

Focus your creative power on a well-defined target.

The highest achievers in the world have all succeeded because they mapped out their visions.

We are goal-seeking creatures.

When you instruct your brain to look for the things you want, you will begin to see them.

When you define your goals, you gave your brain something new to look for and focus on.

Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and why know what they want.

Who do I need to become?

If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.

What stands between you and your goal is your behavior.

You -> Choice + Behavior + Habit + Compounded = Goals

You habits are learned and they can be unlearned.

The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.

## Six Techniques

1. Set Yourself Up to Succeed
2. Think Addition, Not Subtraction
3. Go for a PDA: Public Display of Accountability
4. Find a Success Buddy
5. Competition & Camaraderie
6. Celebrate!

Change is hard.

Extra-ordinary is what will separate you from the crowd.

The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge.

## You Build Up momentum By

1. Making new choices based on your goals and core values.
2. Putting those choices to work through new positive behaviors.
3. Repeating those healthy actions long enough to establish new habits.
4. Building routines and rhythms into your daily disciplines.
5. Staying consistent over a long enough period of time.

A routine is something you do every day without fail.

A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separate the most successful among us from everyone else.

Consistency is the key to achieving and maintaining momentum.

You alone are responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take.

Find a peak performance partner, someone equally committed to study and personal growth as you.

Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritance you can give to others. And it should never end. It is why you get up every day. To teach and be taught.

Never ask advice from someone with whom you wouldn't want to trade places.

You get in life what you tolerate.

You will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of.

Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better.

Go above and beyond when you hit the wall.

You can do more than expected in every aspect of your life.
