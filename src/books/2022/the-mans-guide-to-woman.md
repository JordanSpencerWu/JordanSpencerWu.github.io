Women are mysterious.

Men have the power to make or break a relationship.

It is what you do and the way you think that matters most.

All women are unique.

The number one thing that women look for is trustworthiness.

Trustworthiness is this: You are who you say you are and you do what you say you are going to do.

Be there for them emotionally: listening to them, caring for them, and safeguarding their hearts.

Attunement is when men "attune" to their women, there is less fighting; more frequent and better sex, and both men and women no longer feel so alone.

Trait women want most: trustworthiness.

Trust is built through: emotional connection.

Emotional connection is created through: attunement.

## Just A-TT-U-N-E

- **ATTEND**: Give your undivided attention when it's needed.
- **TURN TOWARD**: Physically. Turn. Toward. Your. Partner.
- **UNDERSTAND**: No matter what she is saying, the goal is understanding. And how you get to understanding is by asking questions.
- **NON-DEFENSIVELY LISTEN**: Don't react. Her feelings are real to her at that moment.
- **EMPATHIZE**: Try to feel how a woman is feeling.

Being genuinely interested in her is much more important than trying to be interesting to her.

If you want a relationship with a woman to last, she needs to know who you are, and she needs to feel safe with you.

For women, being sexual is equivalent to being vulnerable.

Men want less fighting and more sex.

Emotions are not a problem for girls. They are a good thing, an opportunity for intimacy.

For a woman there are no negative emotions.

Emotions are opportunities for intimacy.

The holy trinity for female hormones - estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone determines a woman's day to day reality; what she values; how outgoing or active she is; what her needs are; and what, when, and even who she desires.

Her moods generally have nothing to do with you.

Women experience fear in a very different way than men.

When a woman is afraid, hold her hand and try to help her avoid feeling afraid.

Women are attracted to men who are the CEO and president of themselves.

The woman who ultimately controls whether or not a man approaches her.

Your nonverbal cues that let a woman know you are high status, a protector, a provider.

If she wants you, she will put a bid in your direction. The most common bid is direct eye contact. A smile. Repeatedly glancing at you and away from you. These are the signals; what you do with them is up to you.

Mutual attraction is the only attraction worth having.

The goal of dating is to find someone genuinely interested in you for who you really are.

The way you create safety in a conversation is by being a good listener and being genuinely interested.

Conversation is an art, and it's an art that puts the other person at center stage.

Lower pitched voices in men are considered more attractive to women.

Ask for her phone number or ask her out on a date.

Dating is about putting her front and center.

Dating is also about containing the conversation and getting to know each other.

Pheromones are going to make a woman feel an attraction to you.

A woman's sense of smell is stronger than a man's.

Your smell matters.

A woman always, always remembers the first kiss.

People don't change. At their core, who they are and how they treat others will not change.

Do you trust her?

A great relationship is a mix of heart, mind, and body.

Choose your partner carefully. Your relationship will cause you 90 percent of the joy or sorrow in your life.

How does she make you feel when you are with her?

If your body, mind, and heart are all in alignment with hers, then there's a very good change she's more than a hookup.

Men crave a woman's body and never get tired of looking at a woman's body.

You are beautiful no matter what you wear.

A woman doesn't see herself separately from her body, and therefore she often defines her worth in terms of her body.

A woman's self-esteem is heavily dependent on her own appraisal of her body.

Men can make or break any relationship, and they can also make or break any relationship a woman has with her body.

A woman's desire is dependent on her feeling desirable.

Lovemaking begins with your words, your smiles, and your gaze.

The greatest sex organ a woman has is her mind.

To truly know a woman's body you have to first know her mind and heart.

She needs to feel emotionally and physically safe with you before she can feel completely sexually.

The man every woman wants has a healthy relationship with and respect for the cliteris.

To truly make love to a woman you have to make love to her whole body with your mind, your eyes, your words, your heart, and your touch.

To truly be the hero in a woman's life, you have to be a hero both in and out of the bedroom.

Woman need to feel emotionally connected to have sex, and men need to have sex to feel emotionally connected.

Actual desire for sex is to connect the mind, the heart, and the genitals.

The best things about sex: What's good for her is good for you, and what's good for you is good for her.

When a woman bares her neck it's a major sign of interest, and that is the time for you to appreciate the neck that she has entrusted to your lips.

A man's single greatest tool in his quest to pleasure and satisfy his partner is oral sex.

Best predictor on whether a marriage would last was a woman's clothes consciousness.

If you've entered into a serious relationship with a woman, the truth is, you've also entered into a relationship with her friends.

Men need a woman to stay alive.

What determined whether men would die younger was whether or not they were married, whereas for women it was their friendships with other women that determined their longevity.

The quality of your friendship is important to your relationship, but the quality of her friendships with other women is also important to your relationship.

Stage one is about seeking chemistry.

Stage two is about building trust.

Stage three is about building loyalty.

A man becomes his best self when he has a real partner in life at his side.

When a woman is the right woman for you, you feel comfortable and relaxed.

Men who are socially isolated die young.

Distrust and betrayal are at the heart of every failed relationship.

Hero = turns toward his partner.

Zero = turns away from his partner.
