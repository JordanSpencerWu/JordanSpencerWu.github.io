title: The Rational Male
---

Being educated, on a great many subjects, and learning how to learn, is its own reward.

ONEitis: An unhealthy romantic obsession with a single person. Usually accompanied by unreciprocated affection and completely unrealistic idealization of said person.

There is no ONE. This is the soul-mate myth. There are some good Ones and some bad Ones, but there is no ONE.

There are a lot more ONEs out there that could meet or exceed the criteria we subconsciously set for them to be the ONE.

The definition of Power is not financial success, status, or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives.

In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.

Control in a healthy relationship passes back and forth as desire and need dictate for each partner.

Develop a better sense of self-worth and a better understanding of your true efficacy in your relationships.

Compromise is always going to be a part of any relationship, but what's key is realizing when that compromise becomes the result of manipulation, what is in effect and developing the confidence to be uncompromising in those situations.

No woman's intimacy i.e. sex is ever worth that compromise because in doing so you devalue your own worth to her.

Enlightened self-interest: There is no more a superior confidence for a man than one with the self-understanding that he will not compromise himself for the recognized manipulations of a woman, and the fortitude to walk away knowing he has in the past, and will in the future find a better prospect than her.

Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances.

Real Power is the degree to which we actually control the direction of our lives.

Be unafraid to make ourselves the prize.

You cannot negotiate genuine Desire.

Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance.

Genuine desire in something a person must come to, or be led to, of their own volition.

You want to be with a woman who wants to please you.

Real desire is created by her thinking it's something she wants.

A woman's imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal.

Women never want full disclosure.

Familiarity is anti-seductive.

Women don't want to be comfortable with a potential or proven sex partner, they need their imaginations stroked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with a potential partner.

Date non-exclusively.

Always remember, perfect is boring.

Cultivate an element of unpredictability about yourself prior to and into a long term relationship.

Rejection is better than Regret.

Alpha behaviors are manifestations of an Alpha mindset.

Every guy has a Game. Everyone thinks they are Alpha in their own way.

Your goal should be to attract women effortlessly, so play to your strengths no matter what they are.

Alpha = Leader of Men.

A man is confident and valuable as his options.

A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will manifest itself.

The man who maintains social proof that other women will compete for him, maintains power.

Spinning more plates allows you more opportunity to select from the largest pool of prospective choices and date them or drop them as you see fit.

Experience teaches harshly, but it teaches best and the breadth of experience serves a man well.

Opportunity and options make a man the prize.

Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled with a faithful loser.

Spinning Plates doesn't necessarily mean you're having sex with all of your plates.

Internalize an abundance mentality and be non-exclusive.

Non-exclusivity has to be covert.

Imagination and competition anxiety paired with implied non-exclusivity are the cornerstones of successful plate spinning.

Monogamy is a by-product, not a goal.

We only chase what runs away from us.

Women communicate covertly, with gestures, with looks, with veiled meanings - you have to communicate your intent to be non-exclusive covertly. Never overtly tell a woman you've got other plates than her spinning. Allow her to discover this by your mannerisms, your behaviors, definitely by your availability to her.

Create value through scarcity.

Confidence is derived from options.

It's not a numbers game, it's a non-exclusivity game.

You make the perfect woman.

The point is to mold yourself and any woman who you do exclusively end up with into your own frame.

You cannot help anyone until you've first helped yourself.

One of the biggest obstacles most men have with accepting the fundamentals of a positive masculine mindset is the attitude that personality is static and uncontrollable by them.

It is you who determine what is comfortable for you and what will constitute the trait that makes your personality your own.

Any reasonably attractive women knows you'd like to have sex with her.

As men, our biological impetus is a desire for unlimited access to unlimited sexuality with females bearing the best physical attributes.

Cultivate an attitude of being the prize.

A truly powerful Man's most precious resource is his options and his ability to exercise them.

Control the course of your own life and your own choices.

Women should only ever be a compliment to a man's life, never the focus of it.

You should be the object of women's pursuit.

Woman's first priority is to seek out security.

It is socially acceptable for a woman to blatantly spin plates.

A woman can always change her mind.

All woman are sexual, you just need to be the right guy at the right time for the job.

By practicing honest, non-exclusive dating you communicate to your prospective plates that you are in demand.

Nothing serves a man better than having 3 or 4 women competing for his exclusive attention and fostering in them that feminine competitive anxiety in as subtle and covert a way as possible.

A shit-test is used by women to determining:

1. Confidence
2. Options
3. Security

Abundance thinking is the root of Plate Theory.

The only time a man should even contemplate monogamy is after experiencing abundance.

You create value by scarcity.

Scarcity increases value.

Determine what a quality woman means to you and how to recognize her.

In a committed relationship, you simply cannot spin plates.

A man's default response should always be to excuse him from the let's just be friends situation.

No such thing as a long distance relationship.

Because her intimacy with him is genuine, unnegotiated, unobligated desire. She wants to have sex with him, she doesn't owe him sex.

The very nature of an intergender friendship is always going to be limited by sexual differences.

Covertly communicate to a woman that your goals and determination trump her one real power over you - her sexuality.

The Man you wish to become requires you to take action.

You must kill the Beta you, to become something more.

The longer you remain uncommitted, the more opportunities will be available to you.

Woman want a Man who other men want to be, and other women want to fuck.

Don't consider monogamy until you are mature enough to understand its limiting effects and you've achieved a degree of success to your own satisfaction according to your ambitions and passions.

It's important to have A Look.

The truth will set you free.

Unplugging is accepting the hard truths that Game and a new awareness of gender relations forces upon them.

There is only Game and the degree to which you accept it and are comfortable in using it in the context that you define.

In her uncommited sex life it was a tool for qualification, in her long term relationship life it's a tool for compliance.

Feminine Imperative wants Vagina = Authority and do what she says = get sex.

What is needed is incremental reassertion of yourself as the primary AND that her sexual agency, while still welcomed, is not a motivator for your own decisions.

Women want to be with Men who other woman want to fuck, and other men want to be.

Vagina is Not Authority.

The better you make yourself, the more authority you command.

Nothing is as simultaneously fear inspiring and arousing for women as a Man she suspects is self-aware of his own value.

You are who you believe you are, and you are who she perceives you to be.

A person can improve themselves by changing their outlook and modifying their behavior.

You need to improve yourself to get the things you want.

Comfort and trust are post-orgasm conditions; anxiety, arousal, and sexual urgency are pre-orgasm conditions - and both have their own unique hormonal signatures.

Women with a high interest level won't confuse you.

Women tell the complete truth with their actions.

Only way to determine genuine motivation and/or intent is to observe the behavior of an individual.

Men convey information, women convey feelings.

She wants you to 'get it' on your own.

She wants a Man who knows he needs to be dominant with her.

Communicate with your behavior.

Women NEVER want full disclosure.

Commitment to uniquely reflect feminine interests.

Commitment should be a function of genuine desire.

If I have one life to live and one precious lifetime to do it in, it's a commitment to oneself in learning and securing the best options for a lifetime.

Men are the disposable sex, women, the preserved sex.

Women want the freedom to pursue a short term sexual opportunity and also the prudence to filters for man willing to assume the respnsibilities of parental investment and provisioning.

Hypergamy is a woman's natural preference for a higher status male.

Women naturally prefer the highest status man they can get.

When women are pursuing short and medium term mating they always prefer the most socially dominant male they can get.

The funny thing about regret is, it's better to regret something you have done, than regret something you haven't done.

Truth is supposed to make you uncomfortable in order to inspire you to action.

Accept the game for what it is, understand it and master it.

Don't wish things were easier, wish you were better.

Frame is everything.

Concept of frame is whose reality in which you choose to operate in relation to a woman.

You are either operating in your own frame or you're operating in hers.

It is vital to the health of any long term relationship that a man establishes his frame as the basis of their living together before any formal commitment is recognized.

When a woman resorts to overt communication she's generally exhausted her patience to be covert and this is a desperation tactic for an insecure woman.

When a woman intentionally makes you wait for sex you are not her highest priority.

Sexuality is a spontaneous chemical reaction between two parties, not a process of negotiation.

A woman who wants to fuck you will find a way to fuck you.

Genuine desire cannot be negotiated.

Sex that is motivated by mutual, genuine desire is a tense affair, fueled by testosterone, anxiety, and urgency.

An Alpha wouldn't wait for sex and she know this.

Always remember why women resort to overt communications - so there is no, or less, margin that her message will be misunderstood.

Never under any circumstance live with a woman you aren't married to or are not planning to marry within 6 months.

Never allow a woman to be in control of the birth.

Your self-doubt about your worthiness of a woman's intimacy stems from the preconditioned idea that you're out of her league.

If you think you can't, you're right.

Men have their own rating systems by physical beauty on a scale of 1 to 10.

Disregard for the influence of the feminine imperative that makes the Alpha attractive.

Never self-deprecate under any circumstance.

Never admit a lack of confidence in yourself.

Women want a competent, confident, decisive Man from the outset.

The real test for a man is how he lives with himself, alone.

The man who is comfortable with himself and confident in his true independence is the one that women will want to be associated with and to share in it.

Game and a positive - masculine mindset are vital elements for your attractiveness and well-being.

Women don't want a Man to cheat, but they love a Man who could cheat.
