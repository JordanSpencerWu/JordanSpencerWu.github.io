Three attachment styles: Anxious, Avoidant, and Secure

Adult attachment designates "attachment styles," or manner in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships.

We've been programmed by evolution to single out a few specific individuals in our lives and make them precious to us.

We've been bred to be dependent on a significant other.

Attachment system consists of emotions and behaviors that ensure that we remain safe and protected by staying close to our loved ones.

"Dependency paradox": The more effectively dependent people are on one another, the more independent and daring they become.

Your happiness is something that should come from within and should not be dependent on your lover or mate. Your well-being is not their responsibility, and their is not yours. Each person needs to look after himself or herself.

Develop a "greater sense of self."

When two people form an intimate relationship, they regulate each other's psychological and emotional well-being.

A strong survival advantage is a human couple becoming one physiological unit.

If you want to take the road to independence and happiness, find the right person to depend on and travel down it with that person.

Secure base is the knowledge that you are backed by someone who is supportive and whom you can rely on with 100 percent certainty and turn to in times of need.

If we feel secure. We can take risks, be creative, and pursue our dreams.

When our partners are thoroughly dependable and make us feel safe, and especially if they know how to reassure us during the hard times, we can turn our attention to all the other aspects of life that make our existence meaningful.

When our partner is unable to meet our basic attachment needs, we experience a chronic sense of disquiet and tension that leaves us more exposed to various ailments.

Having a partner who fulfill our intrinsic attachment needs and feels comfortable acting as a secure base and safe haven can help us remain emotionally and physically healthier and live longer.

Activating Strategies are thoughts and feelings that compel you to seek closeness with your partner.

Protest behavior is any action that tries to reestablish contact with your partner and get their attention.

True love means peace of mind.

Abundance philosophy - understanding that there are many unique and wonderful individuals out there who may be superb partners for you.

Experiences are only meaningful when shared with others.

Deactivating strategy is any behavior or thought that is used to squelch intimacy.

If you're secure, you're very reliable, consistent, and trustworthy.

The best predictor of happiness in a relationship is a secure attachment style.

If you're with someone secure, they nurture you into a more secure stance.

Secure attachment styles are characterized by something very real but not outwardly visible - they are programmed to expect their partners to be loving and responsive and don't worry much about losing their partner's love.

Attachment styles are a function of life experience.

Attachment insecurities are partially explained by particular genes.

As a secure person you believe that there are many potential partners open to intimacy and closeness who would be responsive to your needs.

Secure people are less likely to play games.

Effective communication - surface their feelings and see how their date reacts.
