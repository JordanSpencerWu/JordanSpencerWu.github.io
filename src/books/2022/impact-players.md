most people want a good job, buy they also want to make a meaningful contribution; they want their work to matter and to make a difference in the world.

a leader's behavior can either increase or diminish someone's ability to contribute.

Everyone wants to contribute in meaningful ways and make an impact.

Impact Players: players who make a significant contribution individually but who also have an enormously positive effect on the entire team.

## Everyday Challenges

Value decoys - professional habits or beliefs that seem useful and appear appreciated but erode more value then they create.

do the job that was needed.

When we look beyond our ideal job and do the job that needs to be done, we make ourselves useful and much more valuable and increase our influence.

Contributors see themselves as position holders.

Impact Players see themselves as problem solvers.

The most influential professionals are first thinkers and then doers.

By paying attention to what is valued, they learn how to add value. By adding value, they increase their impact.

Impact Players learn what their leaders need and are great practitioners of what I call upward empathy - the tendency to look up at managers and see not only a demanding boss but that boss's challenges, constraints, and best intentions.

The real agenda is what's important right now, and it defines what is relevant and essential for success.

if you aren't working on your boss's top three priorities, you are not working on the agenda.

"When there are unclear roles, you have a choice to make. My choice is to lead."

When you take on more responsibility you make more money.

Impact Players has stewardship mentality a hearfelt desire to make things better both for themselves and for others and a willingness to take responsibility for making things happen.

I can improve this situation.

"Never ask anyone's permission to lead. Just lead."

"It is through real human connections that we earn permission to lead our teams, achieve our goals, and elevate our teammates and ourselves in the process.

3. Step Back

The most influential professionals make a greater impact because they finish the job and finish stronger than others.

Impact Players ensure the job gets done in full, despite unforeseen obstacles and hardships.

Master Skill 1: Changing Your Perspective

To increase our impact we must know what is valuable to others.

when we change our perspective, we can increase our impact.

Master Skill 2: Changing Your Lens

The opportunity lens we take a broader view, seeing options and reasons to take action.

Find something that needs to be done and do it without seeking credit.

Don't settle for just having a job; strive to do work that makes a meaningful impact in whatever position you play.

recruit talent with the right mindset, people who were competitive, curious, and coachable. "three C's".

create a space where co-workers could learn from one another.

A dream team isn't just a dream; it results from carefully curating players with the right mindset, developing them as individuals and as a team, and nurturing a robust, healthy culture.

it's the leader's job to grow the talent they already have.

"If leaders want to unleash individual and collective talent, they must foster a psychologically safe climate where employees feel free to contribute ideas, share information, and report mistakes."

"Not only do leaders need to build psychological safety; they must set high standards and inspire and enable people to reach them."

Create an environment of both safety and stretch in which individuals feel safe to experiment and fail, yet challenged to perform at their best.

1. Define the W.I.N (What's Important Now)
2. Redefine leadership
3. Ask them to stay until the job is done
