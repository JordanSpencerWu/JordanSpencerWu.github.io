title: When Breath Becomes Air

The physician's duty is not to stave of death or return patient to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.

##### Caelica 83: You that seek what life is in death

> You that seek what life is in death,
>
> Now find it air that once was breath.
>
> New names unknown, old names gone:
>
> Till time end bodies, but souls none.
>
> Reader! then make time, while you be,
>
> But steps to your eternity.
