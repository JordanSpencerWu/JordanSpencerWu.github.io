The term \"pseudocode\" refers to an informal, English-like notation for describing how an algorithm, a routine, a class, or a program will work. The PPP defines a specific approach to using pseudocode to streamline the creation of code within routines.</p>\n<p>The process involves designing the class or routine using pseudocode. After you write the code using the pseudocode as a guideline. Once this is completed, you would check and test the correctness of the code. Repeat a step if necessary. Other approaches are test-first development, refactoring, and design by contract.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":["Steve McConnell"],"date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This book contains many useful tips about software construction and best practices on creating clean code.
